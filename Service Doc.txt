A service is an application component that can perform long running operation in the background (No user interface) in the Main (UI ) thread.

Another application component can start a service and it will continue to run in the background even if the user switches to another application

A component can bind to the service and interact with in and also perform inter process communication.

Eg; Network transactions, Play music, File i/o ops, interact with Content providers from background

Started
startService();
 a service can run in the background indefinitely, even if the component that started it is destroyed

bound 
A bound service runs only as long as another application component is bound to it


Should you use a service or a thread?
A service is simply a component that can run in the background even when the user is not interacting with your application. Thus, you should create a service only if that is what you need.

If you need to perform work outside your main thread, but only while the user is interacting with your application, then you should probably instead create a new thread and not a service.
